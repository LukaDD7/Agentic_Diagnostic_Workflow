  "Differentiation Criteria": {  
    "Pain Characteristics": {  
      "Pancreatitis": "[!] Epigastric pain radiating to back, relieved by leaning forward",

**If differential diagnosis needed between acute cholecystitis and acute pancreatitis**
1.How clinicians determine the primary diagnosis when both acute cholecystitis and biliary pancreatitis coexist:
  1)Temporal sequence and anatomical pathway:
    When gallstones migrate from the gallbladder through the cystic duct into the common bile duct and ultimately obstruct the ampulla
    of Vater, this downstream blockage can trigger acute pancreatitis. In such cases, the pancreatic injury is secondary to an
    upstream biliary obstruction, and biliary pancreatitis is typically considered the primary diagnosis.

  2)Severity of inflammation and systemic response:
    If the patient demonstrates systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or shows signs of early organ dysfunction, acute pancreatitis
    is prioritized as the principal condition due to its greater potential for systemic complications.

  3)Laboratory findings consistent with disease etiology:
    Markedly elevated serum amylase and lipase levels, particularly in combination with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level >150 U/L,
    strongly suggest biliary pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis.

  4)Prognostic importance and urgency of intervention:
    Biliary pancreatitis has a higher risk of morbidity and mortality and often necessitates early supportive care and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
    Therefore, it is typically regarded as the more critical and urgent primary diagnosis.

  
2.Coexistence of Acute Cholecystitis and Biliary Pancreatitis
- Both conditions may occur simultaneously due to gallstones migrating through the biliary system.
- Key points for assigning the primary diagnosis:
    1)Evaluate the most acute, dangerous, or systemically impactful process. For example:
      - If pancreatic enzymes (amylase/lipase) are significantly elevated (closely to threefold of the upper limit) and systemic inflammatory response is pronounced, acute biliary pancreatitis is likely the primary diagnosis.
      - If right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and localized radiology imaging gallbladder signs predominate in the absence of significant elevation of enzymes and pancreas sign, acute cholecystitis should be the primary diagnosis.
    2)Clinical decisions should prioritize the diagnosis that most urgently requires systemic support, ICU care, or intervention.
