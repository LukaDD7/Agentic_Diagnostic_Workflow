### 1. **History of Present Illness**
- periumbilical pain that then moves to the right lower quadrant, followed by nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever
- **Abdominal Pain**: Typically presents as migratory right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, starting in the epigastrium or periumbilical region and later shifting to the RLQ.

### 2. **Physical Examination**
- **Specific Sign**: McBurney sign, deep tenderness noted at a location two-thirds of the distance from the umbilicus to the right anterior superior iliac spine (McBurney point).
- **Tenderness**: Tenderness at McBurney's point in the RLQ.
- **Rebound Tenderness**: Rebound tenderness in the RLQ (Blumberg's sign).
- **Muscle Guarding**: Muscle rigidity in the RLQ.

### 3. **Laboratory Tests**
- **White Blood Cell (WBC) Count**: elevated
- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**: elevated.

### 4. **Imaging Investigation**
Signs suggestive of appendix inflammation: 
- enlarged appendix, thickened wall, gas or periappendiceal fluid collection, Dilated appendix,
- periappendiceal fat stranding, appendicolith(fecalith)
- appendiceal rupture, appendiceal wall hyperemic, fat stranding
- Cecal Bar/Wall Thickening
- Intraluminal fluid or gas
- Findings suggesting complications: Periappendiceal abscess/fluid/ascites, 
  Appendiceal perforation,Phlegmon, Bowel obstruction,Fistula formation

    "Intermediate (5-8)": "Need imaging confirmation (CT preferred)",  
    "High Risk (9-12)": "Surgical intervention is recommended"  
  }

      "Parameter": "Elevated CRP (>10 mg/L)",  
      "Value": "Yes",  
      "Points": 1  
    }  
  ],  
  "Interpretation": {  
    "Low Risk (0-2)": "Appendicitis is less likely",  
    "Intermediate (3-4)": "Further evaluation is needed",  
    "High Risk (5-7)": "Highly suggestive of appendicitis"  
  }  
}

### Tips
- CRP level on admission ≥ 10 mg/L and leucocytosis ≥ 16,000/mL are strong predictive factors for appendicitis in pediatric patients.
