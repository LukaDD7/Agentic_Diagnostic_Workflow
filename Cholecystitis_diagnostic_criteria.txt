### 1. Diagnostic Criteria for Cholecystitis (ACG Guidelines 2023)

Diagnosis based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings:

- **Clinical History**:
  - Required: RUQ pain lasting >6 hours
  - Supportive: Nausea/vomiting, Fever (>38°C), History of gallstones

- **Physical Exam**:
  - Key Signs: Murphy's sign positive, RUQ tenderness or guarding
  - Optional: Palpable gallbladder mass

- **Laboratory Tests**:
  - Essential: WBC >10×10⁹/L, CRP >10 mg/L
  - Ancillary: Elevated AST/ALT (if choledocholithiasis suspected)

- **Imaging Criteria**:
  - **Ultrasound**: GB wall thickening >4 mm, pericholecystic fluid, sonographic Murphy’s sign
  - **CT**:
    - GB wall thickening >3 mm with hyperenhancement
    - Pericholecystic fat stranding (“dirty fat” sign)
    - GB distension (transverse >4 cm)
    - Intramural gas (emphysematous cholecystitis)
    - GB wall discontinuity, abscess (perforation)
  - **MRI**:
    - GB wall thickening >3 mm with high T2 signal
    - Pericholecystic fluid (high T2 signal)
    - Gallstones (signal voids on T2/T1)
    - Restricted diffusion in GB wall (DWI hyperintensity)
  - **HIDA Scan**:
    - Non-visualization of GB at 4h
    - Ejection fraction (EF) <35% after CCK stimulation

- **Diagnostic Thresholds**:
  - Definite Diagnosis: Clinical + Imaging confirmation
  - Probable Diagnosis: Clinical + Labs + Partial imaging findings

### 2. Diagnostic Criteria for Cholecystitis (Tokyo Guidelines 2018)

Diagnosis requires one item from each category:

- **Local Signs of Inflammation** (≥1):
  - RUQ tenderness (Murphy’s sign positive)
  - RUQ mass or muscle guarding

- **Systemic Inflammation** (≥1):
  - Fever >38°C
  - WBC >12×10⁹/L
  - CRP ≥10 mg/L

- **Imaging Findings** (≥1):
  - GB wall thickening (>4 mm) or edema
  - Enlarged GB (long >8 cm, short >4 cm)
  - Pericholecystic fluid or abscess
  - Ultrasound Murphy’s sign positive

- **Diagnosis Threshold**:
  - Local inflammation + Systemic inflammation + Imaging evidence → Confirmed diagnosis

---

### 3. Core Imaging Findings in Cholecystitis
- Gallbladder wall thickening or edema
- Gallbladder distention
- Gallstones or sludge
- Pericholecystic fluid
- Sonographic Murphy’s sign
- Hyperemia of GB wall
- Gas in GB wall or lumen (emphysematous cholecystitis)
- Pericholecystic fat stranding
- Biliary duct dilatation

---

### 4. Findings Suggesting Complications (with or without pancreatitis)
- Gallbladder perforation
- Pericholecystic abscess
- Biliary peritonitis

---

### 5. Key Clinical Features for Diagnosing Acute Calculous Cholecystitis (ACC)
- **History & Exam**: RUQ pain/tenderness, fever, vomiting or food intolerance, Murphy’s sign
- **Lab Tests**: Elevated CRP, elevated WBC
- **Imaging**: Signs of gallbladder inflammation

### 6. Cholecystitis vs. Biliary Pancreatitis (Comparison Summary)

| Feature                  | Cholecystitis                          | Biliary Pancreatitis                     |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Primary Site             | Gallbladder                            | Pancreas                                 |
| Imaging                  | GB wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid/fat, stones/sludge | Pancreatic swelling, peripancreatic fluid, ductal dilation |
| CBD Dilation             | May occur (secondary inflammation)     | Often >6 mm (obstructing stone)          |
| Pancreatic Involvement   | Usually normal                         | Often abnormal (edema, necrosis)         |
| Labs                     | ↑WBC, ↑CRP, mild ↑LFTs                 | ↑Amylase/Lipase, ↑ALT/AST                |
| Clinical Presentation    | RUQ pain, Murphy's sign positive, fever| Epigastric pain radiating to back, nausea|
